I am a final-year PhD candidate in the school of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). I am currently working with [Prof. Christopher J. Earls](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/christopher-j-earls) as a part of [Earls Group](https://earls.cee.cornell.edu/) and [SciAI Center](https://sciaicenter.engineering.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University, where I am broadly working in the area of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). I enjoy working on the intersection of math, physics, and programming. During my PhD, I have interned with [Pasteur Labs](https://pasteurlabs.ai/) working on Graph models in a SciML context.

I completed my Integrated Masters in Technology in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) in 2020 with [Prof. Syed Nizamuddin Khaderi](https://sites.google.com/site/snkhaderi/home) as the advisor for my Masterâ€™s thesis. We worked on developing a Finite Element package for modeling crack propagation in solids using Floating Node Method. Before working in Finite Elements I briefly worked in manufacturing. I interned at the MMT lab of Boeing R&T, Bangalore. I worked on numerically modeling Multipoint Thermoforming of sheet metals using ABAQUS.

Apart from research, I have been involved with social entrepreneurship for a brief period of time, where my team reached the Singapore Regional finals of the Hult Prize. I really enjoy playing and listening to music, biking. I absolutely love trying out different foods. F1 is my favorite thing to watch when I am not busy binging an unhealthy quantity of Anime.
